# 👋 Hi, I'm Stephin Biji

🎓 I'm currently a Class 12 student learning Python, Streamlit, and building mini projects step by step.

🚀 I'm passionate about creating useful apps and documenting my journey from school to a career in tech.

🛠️ Projects I'm working on:
- ✅ Grade Checker App (Streamlit)
- 🧠 Quiz App (coming soon)
- 💡 More Streamlit apps on the way!

🎯 Future Goals:
- Become a Python Developer
- Study BCA + MCA
- Join a top tech company like Google, Wipro, or TCS
- Move to the USA for higher studies and work

🔐 Most of my projects are private for now, but I’ll make them public soon!

📩 Feel free to connect with me or follow my journey!
